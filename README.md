##Overview
---
With over 100 museums in New York City, our group set out to create an app for consolidating museum data in a chic, simple to use app. With just three group members and six days to work at the NYC Dev Bootcamp campus, we built a fully functioning app and deployed live at museumfindernyc.herokuapp.com. Our stack is Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript (employing AJAX and the JQuery library) and Bootstrap as our front-end design framework.


##Features
---
Through a custom API combining both NYC Open Data and Google Places, Museum Finder is a one-stop shop for NYC Museum information. The front-end Bootstrap design makes navigating Museum Finder's interface both aesthetically pleasing and straightforward. User's can navigate through a wide array of museum categories, 'favorite' museums to their profile page and even locate a specific museum's address through google maps. Museum Finder also offers a monthly newsletter to users who want monthly emails detailing specials for their favorited museums.


##Future Features
---
Moving forward, we plan on adding a 'notes' feature for users to leave self-reminding notes on their museum experiences. Simultaneously, we plan on writing our front-end in React and get Museum Finder up and running as a mobile app.
